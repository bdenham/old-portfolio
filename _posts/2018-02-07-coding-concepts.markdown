Learning to code with new frameworks or languages can be a weird (even sadistic/masochistic) combination of fun and frustration. The fun comes from learning something new and exciting. It often comes early in the experience, when you start cutting and pasting code samples together and quickly see cool stuff working! The frustration comes from the conceptual walls you'll hit as soon as you want to do anything meaningful beyond the example code you find.

To climb the walls, you'll need to learn the concepts. But a lot of people struggle through this part (or skip it altogether) because it's not as fun as seeing "cool stuff working!" I get it. I'm the same way. And I want to change that. 

I want to make learning concepts just as fun as seeing new code do cool stuff. I think this can be done by combining written descriptions, expressive images, and live code. The following samples are taken from current explorations towards this goal.

### Explainers
Explainers is a concept for an iPhone app focused on explaining coding concepts with a combination of my own descriptions, illustrations, and code samples along with the best quotes from the best authors on the subject.

### Live Code
Here's a live code example from the Explainer concept on JavaScript closures above. With live, editable code, developers can cement the concept into a practical foundation for all the details they will learn later.
